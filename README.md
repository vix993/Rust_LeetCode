# Rust: LeetCode Problems

I have had a keen interest in Rust for a while now and have decided to learn about data structures in this language.

This repository holds my submissions to leetCode problems using Rust as my weapon of choice.

Parralel to learning the syntax I am also interested in exercising my problem solving ability and I figured
solving LeetCode problems kills two birds with one stone.

I do not own the rights to any of these challenges, I am merely posting these here for the purpose of later revision
and optimisation.

You can compile each of these solutions by having rust installed and executing the following commands:

### `rustc file_name.rs`, then `./file_name`
